  <h3>CHILDHOOD</h3>

  <p>Hey there!!! So, if you are visiting my page then you must be one of my friend or maybe relative. So If you are, then Hifive to each one of you. Everyone in this universe carry some sort of story and like others I'm having a story too. My story
    started on 20th May 2003 in Sikar. I guess around 4583 babies were also born that day. I don't know if any one of them were later intertsted in music. I'm not having any clear image of my childhood memories in my mind but one of my favourite
    includes playing cricket with my friends Tinshu (aka Sarthak), Tanu (aka Tarun), Vitthal (aka - -). in the summer vacations under the schorching heat of sun. Our Squad always stood first in the list of gangsters of our colony. But the most
    horrible days were those, when one of us got injured while doing scroundelism and broke his head. The next two-three days went in silence for all of us until our fourth member got ready for doing some crazy things again. Those were the Golden
    Days of my life. I was reluctant towards Outdoor games as I preffered Computer games more, but my friends used to convince me to play outside and sometimes they even dragged me out of my room or complained my Mom about it. I used to hate their
    rude behaviour towards me... but now I wish that I could get back some real caring friends like them again. I miss you guys!!! ❤️ </p>

  <h3>MUSIC JOURNEY</h3>
  </P>
  <p>I was interested in music since my childhood. I grew up listening my Mum humming songs while cooking. She is the first teacher of my life. She taught me not only the musical stuff but all of my basic academic skills were also his pittance. My
    Mama gifted me a guitar on my birthday, on that day it was nothing more than a simple musical instrument for me and I was not very keen of learning to play it until my mom scolded me while I was playing computer games on that day (like all other
    days) and asked me to learn some of its basics from my Mama (because he used to stay with us for a couple of days and all of my future guitar skills were dependent on my interest and efforts). The moment I gave him a hear while he was strumming
    the guitar, I decided to learn it. Unfournately, I could'nt find a good Guitar Teacher for me. So I developed all of my skiils by accessing all the tutorials available on YouTube and listening to different guitarist all over the world. A fire got
    enraged up in my soul while I found that there were no Indians in the list of legendary guitarist from all over the world. From that day, the motivating gear of my guitar jouney is to stand equally with those legends. Moreover its also my
    passion. </p>

  <br>
  In the end, I want to give a big shoutout to my friends DV and NT.
